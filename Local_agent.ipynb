       "  '9 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nPREFACE  \\n \\nFirst aid training is a low cost, but highly effect ive strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality.  \\nWith the help of Belgian Red Cross Centre for Evide nce Practice (CEBaP), Belgian Red Cross-\\nFlanders and a multi-disciplinary expert panel, Ind ian Red Cross Society prepared the \\nevidence-based Indian First Aid Guidelines (IFAG) in 2014 which were used to update the sixth \\nedition of first aid Manual prepared for the genera l public by the St. John Ambulance (India) \\nand the Indian Red Cross Society. \\nFirst aid has been practised in the world since ant iquity. There is enough evidence that it was \\nused to give relief to the injured and sick persons in wars and calamities in India since the times \\nof Mahabarata. The use of first aid techniques expa nded and improved with time, but it got \\nthe real fillip when the Red Cross Movement started  in the world about 150 years ago. \\nConsequently, The Indian Red Cross Society was esta blished in 1920 through an Act of the \\nParliament. Until then, the St. John Ambulance carr ied out Red Cross work in addition to its \\nnormal activities. \\nTo provide the right and effective help before a trained health worker is available or the victim \\nreaches a health facility, it needs to be given by the laypersons who happen to be present',\n",
       "  'reaches a health facility, it needs to be given by the laypersons who happen to be present \\nwherever a person suffers from an injury or illness. This will only be possible when a large number \\nof laypeople are trained in evidence-based first aid techniques. Presently, about 6 lakh persons \\nare trained in India every year in the basic first aid. The number looks impressive, but is not \\nadequate considering the huge population and vast a rea not having good communication \\nfacilities. \\nThis seventh edition of the Indian First Aid Manual (IFAM) has several new and updated features. \\nA brief on anatomy and physiology has been provided on each system. The chapter on cardio \\npulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been completely r evised. More emphasis has been put on \\nchest compression to ensure improvement in the bloo d supply to heart and brain, and use of \\ndirect pressure to the site of bleeding to control further bleeding. A chapter on handwashing \\nhas been added to prevent the transmission of infec tions between the victim and first aiders. \\nGuidelines related to snake bites have been totally  revised considering the after effects of \\ntourniquet binding. Useful guidelines have been add ed for important public health problems \\nsuch as diarrhoea, fever, diabetes, emergency childbirth etc. which still claim many lives.',\n",

Being laymen in the field of medicine, \\nit is expected that they will practice the basic principles of first aid and render such aid needed \\nby the casualty (casualties) till medical aid arrives or the person(s) has (have) been transported \\nto the hospital. The basic characteristic of this m anual is to make the layman fully competent \\npractically in the subject. \\nThe first aid guidelines in this manual have been b ased on the latest available and accessible \\nscientific and medical knowledge. In 2014, a team o f Indian medical and first aid specialists \\npublicised the Indian First Aid Guidelines (IFAG). These guidelines are developed using a \\nrigorous and transparent methodology to overcome po tential biases; are based on extensive \\nresearch, data analysis and reviews; and are specif ically adapted to be implemented within \\nthe Indian context.  These guidelines are further c omplemented by the 2015 guidelines on \\nresuscitation and first aid as published by Interna tional Liaison Committee on Resuscitation \\n(ILCOR) and the American Heart Association (AHA). T he editorial board reviewed the \\napplicability of available first aid guidelines int o the specific Indian context and rephrased or',\n",

For interventions were ne ither IFAG nor international first aid \\nguidelines existed, or in case sufficient or scientifically evidence was not available, the editorial \\nboard decided to include the commonly applied first aid practices.  \\nIn the first chapter, this manual specifies in detail what “first aid” is about and how to deal with \\nan emergency. It further includes basic first aid t echniques the first aider should master, i.e. \\nobserving vital signs and consciousness; cardiopulm onary resuscitation (CPR); recovery \\nposition, the first assessment of a casualty; and handwashing. \\nThe subsequent chapters describe a more in-depth fi rst aid approach and techniques.  \\nThe structure of these chapters is: \\n\\x01 Each chapter begins with a short overview of the an atomy and physiology.  \\n\\x01 For specific situation or condition, a list of sign s and symptoms a lay person may \\nobserve and recognize are included in the section ‘What do I see and enquire? ’ \\n\\x01 This section is immediately followed by ‘ What do I do? ’ listing a sequence of first \\naid guidelines and techniques appropriate for that situation or condition. \\nDrawings support the student/reader in understandin g specific positions, \\ntechniques or signs.',\n",

       "  '13 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\n\\x01 The contents of a first aid box are listed at the l ast few pages of the manual. \\nThroughout the manual we opted to use the terms ‘in jured person’, ‘casualty’ or simply ‘the \\nperson’ as a person who got injured or even killed by some event. If the reason is a disease or \\nillness, the term ‘sick person’ is used. \\nThe guidelines and instructions are intended to be applied on both male and female \\ncasualties. To make the reading easier, and instead  of writing ‘he/she’, we opted to use the \\npronoun ‘he’ meaning that the guideline or instruction is applicable both for male and female \\nvictims. Only if the intervention is specifically a pplicable to females, we use ‘she’ in the \\ninstructions.  \\nThis manual is limited in describing the guidelines , interventions and techniques in words and \\npictures only. To acquire a practical knowledge, it  is important to practice the specific \\ntechniques, i.e. basic first aid techniques e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), how to put \\na person into recovery position, etc. First aid course organized by the Indian Red Cross Society \\nand the St John Ambulance Association India are ide al opportunities in achieving a clear \\ninsight in the techniques and allows to exercise th e theory into practice via simulation and on \\ndummies.',\n",

       "  '15 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nA.1  AIMS OF FIRST AID  \\nFirst aid is the first assistance or treatment give n to a casualty or a sick person for any injury or \\nsudden illness before the arrival of an ambulance, the arrival of a qualified paramedical or \\nmedical person or before arriving at a facility that can provide professional medical care.  \\nAs a consequence of disaster or civil strife people suffer injuries which requires urgent care and \\ntransportation to the nearest healthcare facility. \\nA.1.1  AIMS OF FIRST AID  \\nThe aims of first aid are: \\n\\x01 to preserve life, \\n\\x01 to prevent the worsening of one’s medical condition , \\n\\x01 to promote recovery, and \\n\\x01 to help to ensure safe transportation to the neares t healthcare facility. \\nA.1.2  THE FIRST AIDER  \\nA first aider is the term describing any person who has received a certificate from an authorised \\ntraining body indicating that he or she is qualified to render first aid.  \\nFirst aid certifications issued by St. John Ambulan ce Association and the Indian Red Cross \\nSociety are awarded to candidates who have attended a course of theoretical and practical \\nwork and who have passed a professionally supervised examination.',\n",
       "  '16 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nA.2  FIRST AID AND THE LAW  \\nA.2.1  INDIAN GOOD SAMARITAN PROTECTION GUIDELINES  \\nA Good Samaritan in legal terms refers to “someone who renders aid in an emergency to an \\ninjured person on a voluntary basis”.  \\nThe Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has pub lished the Indian Good Samaritan and \\nBystanders Protection Guidelines in The Gazette of India in May 2015 (Notification No \\n25035/101/2014-RS dated 12 May 2015). The guideline s are to be followed by hospitals, police \\nand other authorities for the protection of Good Samaritans. \\nFollowing guidelines are included (sub-selection of the guidelines): \\n1.  A bystander or Good Samaritan, including an eyewitn ess of a road accident may \\ntake an injured to the nearest hospital and should be allowed to leave immediately. \\nThe eyewitness has to provide his address. No quest ions are to be asked. \\n2.  The bystander or Good Samaritan shall not be liable  for any civil and criminal \\nliability. \\n3.  A bystander or Good Samaritan who makes a phone cal l to inform the police or \\nemergency services for the person lying injured on the road cannot be compelled \\nto give his name or personal details on the phone o r in person. The disclosure of \\ncontact details of the Good Samaritan is to be volu ntary. \\n4.  The lack of response by a (medical) doctor in an em ergency pertaining to road',\n",
       "  \"4.  The lack of response by a (medical) doctor in an em ergency pertaining to road \\naccidents (where he is expected to provide care) sh all constitute ‘Professional \\nMisconduct’. \\nA.2.2  DUTY OF GIVING CARE  \\nUsually, if a volunteer comes to the aid of an injured or sick person who is a stranger, the person \\ngiving the aid owes the stranger a duty of being reasonably careful.  \\nIn relation to the “duty of giving care”, there is currently (2015) no legal obligation for first aiders \\nto provide first aid in a general public context, n ot unless it's part of a job description. First aid  \\nofficers in workplaces and school teachers have a duty of care. \\nOnce a first aider begins to provide first aid, a duty of care is established and the first aider then \\nhas an obligation to fulfil the duty of care.  \\nIf a road user is involved in an accident, there is a legal requirement to stay at the scene, assist \\nthe injured and report the incident to the police. \\nNot fulfilling a duty of giving care leaves the fir st aider open to questions of negligence. Whilst \\nthere is no law that forces anyone to treat a casua lty this does not mean that one can simply \\nleave a casualty who you know is in danger.  To do so may make you liable through your \\nomission to act.   If you are not happy to provide first aid there are several things you can and \\nshould do including (but not limited to):\",\n",
       "  'should do including (but not limited to):  \\n\\x01 inform someone else, such as the police or the emer gency services; \\n\\x01 make the area around the casualty safe for yourself , others and the casualty; \\n\\x01 monitor the casualty and/or find out what happened;  and \\n\\x01 comfort the casualty.',\n",
       "  '17 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nA.2.3  CONSENT OF THE PERSON IN NEED  \\nA conscious person has the right to either refuse or accept care. If the person is conscious, you \\nmust ask for his consent before commencing any firs t aid. If he refuses your help, stay nearby \\nand call the police and emergency services, who can then deal with the situation. \\nIf the person is under 18, it is best to obtain con sent from his parent or guardian if they are \\npresent. If they refuse your help, stay nearby and call the police and the emergency services, \\nwho can then deal with the situation. \\nIf the person is unconscious or unable to formally consent, his consent is inferred and you can \\nthen give the necessary first aid. \\nA.2.4  PRIVACY  \\nIn any first aid situation, the first aider must ta ke steps to assist the person to maintain personal \\nprivacy. This means things like, keeping crowds awa y, putting up a screen if necessary, and \\ncovering any exposed body parts with blankets, or sheets, if available. \\nThe first aider also needs to take steps to maintain confidentiality. This means not talking about \\nthe incident to other people, or answering question s from the media, unless you have \\npermission from the person involved in the accident. \\nA.2.5  NEGLIGENCE  \\nIf a volunteer comes to the aid of an injured or sick person who is a stranger, the person giving',\n",

       "  '18 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nA.3  DEALING WITH AN EMERGENCY  \\nEmergency situations vary greatly but there are four main steps that always apply:  \\n1.  Make the area safe. \\n2.  Evaluate the injured person’s condition. \\n3.  Seek help. \\n4.  Give first aid. \\nA.3.1  STEP 1:  MAKE THE AREA SAFE  \\nYour own safety should always come first.  \\nAs a first aider, you should:  \\n\\x01 try to find out what has just happened; \\n\\x01 check for any danger: is there a threat from traffi c, fire, electricity cables, etc.; \\n\\x01 never approach the scene of an accident if you are putting yourself in danger; \\n\\x01 do your best to protect both the injured person(s) and other people on the scene; \\n\\x01 be aware that the property of the injured person is  at risk. Theft can occur. So mind \\nyour safety, and \\n\\x01 seek police or emergency help if an accident scene is unsafe and you cannot offer \\nhelp without putting yourself in danger. \\nAn important part of safety also includes washing your hands and wearing gloves or \\na protection when coming in contact with the injured or sick person’s blood or body \\nfluids.  \\nIn case of road accidents, as a first aider, you should:  \\n\\x01 always follow the traffic rules; \\n\\x01 ask other people to warn traffic about the event; \\n\\x01 if possible, place a warning sign at a good distance, at least 30 meters to either side \\nof the accident, to warn traffic. Do not forget to remove the warning signs',\n",

       "  '19 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\n\\x01 try to apply the handbrake of vehicles involved in the accident to prevent them \\nfrom moving. You can also put something against the  tyres to prevent rolling. \\nAs a general rule, the injured person should not be moved from the scene of an  accident. \\nAny movement may make the injury worse if there has been a head, neck,  back, and leg or \\narm injury.  \\nOnly move injured people if: \\n\\x01 the injured person is in more danger if he is left there, \\n\\x01 the situation cannot be made safe, \\n\\x01 medical help will not arrive soon, and \\n\\x01 you can do so without putting yourself in danger. \\nA.3.2  STEP 2:  EVALUATE THE CONDITION OF THE SICK OR INJURED PERSON  \\nIf it is safe, you can evaluate the sick or injured person’s condition.  Always check that he is \\nconscious and breathing normally.  Situations in which consciousness or breathing are \\nimpaired are often life threatening.   \\nBleeding can also happen inside the body and can be life-threatening although the loss  of \\nblood is not seen.  \\nTechniques of resuscitation (CPR), the recovery position, etc. are explained in this manual. \\nA.3.3  STEP 3:  SEEK HELP  \\n \\nOnce you have evaluated the sick or injured person’ s condition you can decide if help is \\nneeded urgently. \\nIf help is needed, ask a bystander to call for help. Ask him to come back and confirm \\n that help \\nis underway.',\n",
       "  'needed urgently. \\nIf help is needed, ask a bystander to call for help. Ask him to come back and confirm \\n that help \\nis underway. \\nIf you call for help, be prepared to have the following information available:',\n",

Always stay  calm and answer their questions calmly. \\nThe call takers are professionals and will give you further guidance.  \\nIf an ambulance can be obtained in a short time, it  is best to call for one and use it to \\ntransport the injured or sick person to  the healthcare facility. An ambulance  is the best way \\nto transport ill or injured persons, but they are not  always and everywhere quickly available.  \\nYou can always  ask the police for help.  \\nIf no help is available, you will have to arrange transport yourself (in a van, a truck, a car, an \\nauto-rickshaw, a motorbike, a scooter, a bike-rickshaw, a bike...).  Always move the sick or \\ninjured person with great care.  \\nA.3.4  STEP 4:  PROVIDE FIRST AID  \\nGive first aid in accordance with the instructions given in the following chapters in this manual.',\n",
       "  'A.3.4  STEP 4:  PROVIDE FIRST AID  \\nGive first aid in accordance with the instructions given in the following chapters in this manual. \\nWhen providing first aid, try to protect an ill or injured person from cold and heat. \\nDo not give anything to eat or drink to a person who is:  \\n\\x01 severely injured, \\n\\x01 feeling nausea, \\n\\x01 becoming sleepy, or  \\n\\x01 falling unconscious. \\nIn fact, as a general principle, the rule is not to give a casualty anything to drink or eat. \\nImportant exceptions include hypothermia (low body temperature), hypoglycaemic \\nshock (low blood sugar in a diabetes patient), diar rhoea and fever leading to \\ndehydration and in case of heat exhaustion or heatstroke .  The details can be reviewed \\nin the specific chapters on these conditions. \\nBe aware that experiencing an emergency situation i s a very stressful experience for the \\ninjured or sick person.',\n",

This will help to relax him; \\n\\x01 listen to the person and show concern and kindness;  \\n\\x01 make him as comfortable as possible; \\n\\x01 if he is worried, tell him that it is normal to be afraid; \\n\\x01 if it is safe to do so, encourage family and loved ones to stay with him; and \\n\\x01 explain to the sick or injured person what has happened and what is going to happen. \\nA.3.5  WHEN CAN I STOP PROVIDING FIRST AID ? \\nThe question arises when your first aid ‘duty’ comes to an end?  \\nWithin first aid, CPR is a lifesaving activity. But  when you can stop giving CPR? There are four \\nreasons allowing you to stop CPR: \\n\\x01 you see a sign of life, such as breathing; \\n\\x01 someone trained in first aid or a medical professio nal takes over;  \\n\\x01 you are too exhausted to continue; or  \\n\\x01 the scene becomes unsafe for you to continue.',\n",
       "  '22 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nA.4  STRESS WHEN GIVING FIRST AID  \\nIt is only normal to feel stress if you are suddenly faced with the need to give first aid in  a real \\nemergency.  \\nTry to bring your emotions under control before you  proceed. \\nYou may take some  time to \\nstand back from the situation and regain your calm. Do not set about  the task too hastily and \\ndo not under any circumstances place your own safety at risk.  \\nIt is not always easy to process a traumatic event emotionally. It is not unusual for first  aiders to \\nexperience difficulty when working through their em otions afterwards. Talk  to your friends, \\nfamily, fellow first aiders or someone else. If you are still worried, talk  to a professional and seek \\ncounselling.',\n",
       "  '23 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nA.5  RESUSCITATION (BASIC CPR ) \\nReviving someone who is unconscious and/or not breathing or not breathing normally is called \\nresuscitation.  \\nIf the victim is not breathing or is not breathing normally, any source of suffocation should be \\nremoved and resuscitation is to be started. \\nChest compressions with or without rescue breathing s are performed by an individual during \\ncardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in an attempt to restore spontaneous circulation.  \\nFor untrained or minimally trained first aid provid ers treating an adult victim, compression-only \\nCPR is recommended.  These chest compressions ensure a small but crucial supply of blood to \\nthe heart and brain.  \\nFor formally trained first aid providers (and professionals) treating an adult victim, compression \\nwith breaths is recommended. If the trained first a id provider is unable or unwilling, or in any \\nother circumstance, compression-only CPR may be substituted for compression with breaths. \\nFor babies and children under one year, compressions with breaths are always recommended. \\nA.5.1  WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE ? \\nIn case of a cardiac arrest (heart stops functionin g) you might notice the following signs: \\n\\x01 sudden collapse, \\n\\x01 loss of consciousness, \\n\\x01 no breathing, \\n\\x01 no pulse (however this is not always easy for laypeople to confirm).',\n",

A person may be unc onscious for a few seconds (as is the \\ncase with fainting) or for longer periods of time.   \\nPeople who become unconscious do not respond to lou d sounds or shaking. They may even \\nstop breathing or their pulse may become faint. This calls for immediate emergency attention. \\nThe sooner the person receives emergency first aid, the better it is. \\nThe  AVPU scale (an acronym from \"alert, voice, pain, un responsiveness\") is a system by which \\na first aider can measure and record a patient\\'s resp onsiveness, indicating the level of \\nconsciousness. It is based on the casualty’s eye op ening, verbal and movement (motor) \\nresponses.  \\nThe AVPU scale has only four possible outcomes: \\n\\x01 A – Alert.  \\nThe person is fully awake (although not necessarily oriented).

It could be opening his \\neyes, responding to your questions or initiating a move. These responses could be as little \\nas a grunt, moan, or slight movement of a limb when prompted by the voice of the rescuer. \\n\\x01 P – Responding to pain. \\nThe patient makes a response of any kind on the app lication of pain stimulus, such as a \\ncentral pain stimulus like a  rub on his breastbone or a peripheral stimulus such as squeezing \\nhis fingers.  \\nPatients with some level of consciousness (a fully conscious patient would not require any \\npain stimulus) may respond by using their voice, moving their eyes, or moving part of their \\nbody (including abnormal posturing). \\n\\x01 U - Unresponsiveness also noted as 'Unconsciousness '. \\nThis outcome is recorded if the patient does not give any eye, voice or motor response to \\nvoice or pain. \\nTo check a person’s responsiveness/consciousness state check the following: \\n1.  A person who looks around, speaks, responds clearly  to questions, feels touch and \\nmoves or walks around, is considered alert (A). \\n2.  The person opens his eyes and responds to simple qu estions: \\n\\x01 “What is your name?” \\n\\x01 “Where do you live?” \\n\\x01 “How old are you?” \\nThe person responds to simple commands: \\n\\x01 “Squeeze my hand.” \\n\\x01 “Move your arm/leg/foot/hand.”\",\n",

If there is still no response, pinch the person and see if he opens his eyes or moves. \\n  If the person responds to pain, he is responsive to pain (P) \\nIf the person does not react to any of these stimuli, he is in an unconscious state (U).   \\nNote that a person might only partially respond to the stimuli you provide (sound,  touch, \\npain) and might be in an in-between (groggy) state.',\n",

Reasons for \\nblockage may be: \\n\\x01 Loss of muscular control in the throat may allow th e tongue to sag back and block \\nthe air passage. \\n\\x01 When the reflexes are impaired, saliva may lie in t he back of the throat, blocking \\nthe airway. \\n\\x01 Any foreign body in the throat may block the air pa ssage e.g. vomit, blood, \\ndentures etc.  \\nIt is essential to establish a clear airway immedia tely. Unless you can clearly see that \\nthe person is breathing normally, an unconscious person must be turned onto his back \\nto unblock the breathing passage and to check for b reathing. Unblocking the \\nbreathing passage takes priority over concerns abou t a potential spinal injury. \\nTo observe the breathing do following: \\n1.  If the person is unconscious and is not on his back , turn him on to his back.  \\n2.  Kneel beside the casualty. \\n3.  Lift the chin forwards with the index and middle fi ngers of one hand while pressing \\nthe forehead backwards with the palm of the other h and.

       "  '47 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nB.1  RESPIRATION    \\nOxygen is essential to life. Every time we breathe in, air containing oxygen enters the lungs. \\nWhen we breathe out air containing waste products i s removed from the lungs. In each \\ninspiration we take approximately 500 cc of air in.  \\nRespiration is defined as the transport of oxygen from the outside air to the cells within the body \\ntissues, and the transport of carbon dioxide (a waste product) in the opposite direction.  \\nB.1.1  THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM  \\n \\nB.1.1.1  THE AIR PASSAGES  \\nThe air passages consist of the nose, throat (phary nx), wind pipe (trachea) and air-tubes \\n(bronchi). The bronchi divide into minute branches (bronchioles) which end in the lung \\nsubstance (alveoli). \\nB.1.1.2  THE LUNGS  \\nThe lungs (two in number) are situated on the right and left sides of the chest cavity. Each lung \\nis made up of a number of small sacs, called alveol i. The lungs are covered by a membrane \\ncalled ‘pleura’ which lines the inner wall of the chest cavity.',\n",
       "  '48 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\n \\nB.1.2  THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES  \\nThe respiratory muscles, diaphragm, intercostal and  abdominal muscles help to contract and \\nexpand the lungs to facilitate the breathing. \\nB.1.3  MECHANISM OF RESPIRATION  \\n \\nDuring inspiration (breathing in), the diaphragm (t he muscle separating the chest from the \\nabdominal cavity) flattens and increases the chest capacity from above downwards. The ribs \\nmove upwards and forwards increasing the capacity of the chest cavity from front to back by \\nthe action of the muscles situated between the ribs; the lungs thus expand and air enters them. \\nThis is an active process. \\nDuring expiration (breathing out) the reverse process takes place. The diaphragm comes back \\nto its \\n original state and the ribs fall back thus forcing the air out of the lungs. This is a passive \\nprocess. \\nSmall blood vessels (capillaries) surround the alve oli. \\n The exchanges of oxygen and carbon \\ndioxide take place through the blood circulating in  these capillaries. Oxygen is absorbed by \\nthe red blood corpuscles of the blood; water vapour  and carbon dioxide are let out from the \\nblood plasma into the alveoli and expelled out. \\nThe lungs are also supplied with nerves which are c onnected to an area in the brain called \\nrespiratory centre.

For ot hers, it can be a major problem that \\ninterferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. \\nAsthma may not be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Person may be known to have \\nasthma and prescribed medications.  This can be est ablished by taking history from the \\ncasualty. \\nB.8.1  WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE ? \\nFollowing signs can be seen in a person having an asthma attack: \\n\\x01 The person has difficulty in breathing.   \\n\\x01 The person experiences as if he does not get enough  air. \\n\\x01 Sometimes the person breathes rapidly or coughs. In  some cases he coughs up \\nmucus. \\n\\x01 The breathing makes a whistling or wheezing sound w hen exhaling. \\n\\x01 The person complains of tightness or pain in the ch est. \\n\\x01 The person has troubled sleeping due to the shortne ss of breath. \\n\\x01 Symptoms of asphyxia (grey blue tinge of lips and n ail-beds). \\n\\x01 If the attack lasts long, exhaustion may occur. \\nB.8.2  WHAT DO I DO ? \\nB.8.2.1  SUPPORT THE PERSON WITH THE ASTHMA ATTACK  \\n1.

       "  '70 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nC.1  THE HEART AND THE BLOOD CIRCULATION  \\nC.1.1  HEART AND BLOOD CIRCULATION  \\nThe heart is a muscular organ situated at the centre of the chest cavity. It acts as a pump. It is \\ndivided into four chambers. The right upper chamber  called the right atrium receives impure \\nblood from all parts of the body through blood vessels called veins.  \\n   \\nWhen the heart muscle contracts (the heart beats) t his impure blood is passed into the right \\nlower chamber, called right ventricle , and finally finds its way to the lungs where it i s purified. \\nDuring the process of purification, it gives up car bon-dioxide and takes a fresh quantity of \\noxygen.',\n",
       "  '71 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nThe purified blood finds its way into the left upper chamber called left atrium . It then passes to \\nthe left lower chamber, called left ventricle , and from there, in the course of the beating of the \\nheart the purified blood is discharged into various  blood vessels called arteries  and capillaries  \\nwhich convey this purified blood for the nourishmen t for the body as a whole including the \\nheart muscles. Thus each heart is in fact two pumps put together. \\nC.1.2  BLOOD PRESSURE  \\nThe pressure in the arteries varies with the beatin g of the heart. When the heart contracts the \\npressure in the arterial system increases; when the  heart relaxes, the pressure in the arteries \\ndecreases. The pressure exerted on the main arterie s is known as the blood pressure  and is \\nrecorded by a blood pressure measuring instrument. \\nC.1.3  PULSE  \\nWith each heartbeat blood is ejected into the arter ial system. Most of the arteries are placed \\ndeep in the body except on the wrist, elbow, neck, groin and ankle. So arterial pulse is normally \\nfelt over the lateral side of the wrist, in the nec k, temples, and groin and near the ankle. You \\nmay not be able to feel arteries even at these site s (except carotid artery in the neck which is \\na major artery near to the heart) when the person i s in shock. Nevertheless, feeling the pulse',\n",

Nevertheless, feeling the pulse \\ncorrectly is not always easy and requires training.  \\nPulse rate in a normal resting adult is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Tachycardia refers \\nto the heart beating too fast at rest - over 100 beats per minute.',\n",

It circulates in a \\nclosed system formed by the heart, the arteries, ca pillaries and the veins. An average adult \\nhas a volume of five to six litres blood which constantly circulates.  \\nThe blood is a thick viscid liquid of bright red or  scarlet colour when it flows from the heart to \\nthe arteries and takes a dark red or purple hue when it comes back to the heart via the veins. \\nIt has a saline taste.',\n",
       "  '73 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nFigure c02 ipv C0 …Blood consists of varieties of cells:  \\n\\x01 The blood cells which carry haemoglobin (which enables the cells to carry oxygen) \\nare red in colour and are known as red blood corpus cles (RBC).  \\n\\x01 The other cells are white blood corpuscles (WBC) (w hich play a role in the defence \\nof the body against infections) and platelets (whic h help the blood to clot).  The \\nremainder yellowish liquid portion of the blood is called plasma which contains \\nproteins, enzymes and other important ingredients. \\n\\x01 Whenever blood comes in contact with some external material it tends to solidify, \\nforming a clot to stop further bleeding. When the b lood clots inside the arteries, \\nveins or the heart it is referred to as a thrombus.  \\nC.1.5  HOW BLOOD CLOTS  \\nWhen a blood vessel is severed or damaged, it const ricts (narrows) in order to prevent \\nexcessive amounts of blood from escaping.  At a fir st stage, specialized blood cells called \\nplatelets  come into contact with the damaged vessel wall, be come sticky and start to clump \\nat the site of the injury. \\nInjured tissue cells at the site of the wound together with the clumped platelets , trigger a series \\nof complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a substance called fibrin . Strands \\n(filaments) of fibrin come together to form a mesh,  which traps blood cells to make a blood',\n",

The clot releases a pale-coloured fluid, call ed serum , which contains antibodies and \\nspecialised cells. The serum begins the process of repairing the damaged area. At first the \\nblood clot is a jelly-like mass. Later it dries out into a crust (scab) that seals and protects the site \\nof the wound until the healing process is complete.',\n",
       "  '74 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nC.2  CHEST DISCOMFORT  \\nLike all body organs, the heart also needs blood to  function properly. If someone \\ncomplains of chest discomfort, it may be a sign that not  enough blood is flowing to the heart \\nmuscles. This is very serious and can indicate that the person may suffer from a heart attack. \\nA heart attack happens when there is a blockage of the blood flow to  some parts of the \\nheart muscle. In that case, a part of the heart muscle starts to die as soon as that region does \\nnot get any blood supply. It is serious even if the sick person says that nothing is wrong with \\nhim.  \\nWhen a\\n person complains of chest pain, always suspect an i mpending heart attack. \\nHowever, not every chest discomfort or pain is a heart attac k. Several other less problematic \\nhealth problems present with similar symptoms.  \\nDiagnosing a heart attack may not be easy, even for a trained medical staff!  \\nExtra alarm bells to make you consider a heart-related problem are:  \\n\\x01 The pain remains longer than 15 minutes. \\n\\x01 The pain is provoked by effort (exertion pain). \\n\\x01 There is relief when resting. \\n\\x01 The person is known to have cardiac problems or has  been prescribed cardiac \\nmedicines. \\nC.2.1  WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE ? \\n \\nYou might observe the following signs and symptoms when a person is having a heart  attack:  \\n\\x01 discomfort, tightness or pain in the chest;',\n",

Tell him to come back to you to confirm \\nif help has been secured. \\nC.2.2.2  PROVIDE FIRST AID  \\n \\n3.  Make the person lie down in a comfortable position, or propped up position if lying \\ndown is not possible. A semi- reclined position is often the most comfortable for such \\ncases. \\n4.  Ask him to rest and not move. He should rest wherever he is at that moment. \\n5.  Loosen tight clothing for more comfort. \\n6.  Reassure the person and tell him what is happening. \\n7.  Ask if the person is taking medication for his heart condition.  If so, allow the person to \\ntake the prescribed medication. \\nIf the patient has prescribed nitro-glycerine with him, it is safe \\n for him to take up to three \\ndoses. \\n \\n8 .  If there is aspirin available, ask the person to chew on an  aspirin tablet and swallow it \\nwith some water afterwards. Tell him that this will help the blood flow to the heart.   \\n9 .  Arrange urgent transport to a nearby healthcare facility or hospital.  \\n10.  Keep observing the person in case he collapses.',\n",

       "  '77 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nC.3  BLEEDING  \\nBlood circulates in blood vessels (arteries, veins,  and capillaries). When a blood vessel is \\ndamaged, several mechanisms are activated to contro l blood loss: the vessel constricts, and \\na series of chemical reactions occur to form a blood clot as a “plug” over the damaged area. \\nIf blood vessels are torn or severed, uncontrolled blood loss may occur before clotting can take \\nplace, and shock  may develop. \\nC.3.1  TYPES OF BLEEDING  \\nA bleeding can be classified by the type of the blood vessel that has been damaged: \\n\\x01 Arterial bleeding. \\n \\nArteries carry bright red oxygen rich blood under p ressure from the heart. If an artery is \\ndamaged, the bleeding may be profuse. The blood wil l spurt out of it in time with the \\nheartbeat. If a main artery is severed, the blood may jet several feet high. In this case, the \\nvolume of the circulating blood will fall rapidly.  \\n\\x01 Venous bleeding. \\n \\nThe blood in the veins, having given up its oxygen into the tissues, is dark red. The blood \\nflows under less pressure than arterial blood, but the vein walls can widen greatly and the \\nblood can ‘pool’ inside them. If a major vein is da maged, the blood may gush from it \\nprofusely.',\n",
       "  '78 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\n\\x01 Capillary bleeding. \\n \\nBleeding from the capillaries occurs with any wound. At first the bleeding may be brisk, but \\nblood loss is usually slight. A blow may rupture ca pillaries under the skin, causing bleeding \\ninto the tissues (bruising). \\nA bleeding can also be classified by its location: \\n\\x01 External bleeding. \\nIf the bleeding is from the surface of the body, it is called an external bleeding. \\n\\x01 Internal bleeding. \\nIf the bleeding is within the skull, chest and abdo men or inside the body, it is called an \\ninternal bleeding. These bleedings might not been n oticed immediately. At a later stage, \\nblood might ooze out of the nose or ears (bleeding inside the head), be coughed up \\n(bleeding inside the lungs), vomited or defecated ( bleeding inside the digestive tract) or \\nurinated out (bleeding inside the urinary tract).',\n",

       "  '87 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nD.  WOUNDS AND INJURIES  \\nA wound is an injury in which the skin or another s urrounding surface is torn, pierced, cut or \\notherwise broken. Wounds can be external or internal in the body. Each type of wound carries \\nspecific risks associated with the surrounding tissue damage and infection. \\nD.1  TYPES OF WOUNDS  \\n\\x01 Abrasions \\n \\nThese wounds are superficial wounds in which the to p most layers of the skin are scraped \\noff, leaving a raw, tender area. These wounds appea r often when experiencing a sliding \\nfall (e.g. of a bike). The wounds often contain emb edded foreign particles which may \\nresult in infections. Abrasions do not bleed much, but are usually very painful. \\n\\x01 Incisions \\n \\nIncised wounds are caused by sharp instruments such  as a knife, razor, etc. The blood \\nvessels show a straight cut and bleeding may be profuse. Other structures such as tendons \\nand nerves may be damaged too. \\n\\x01 Contusions (bruises) \\n \\nContused wounds are caused by blows, by blunt instr uments or by punching. The \\ncapillaries are ruptured by the punch and blood lea ks into the tissues. Severe contusion \\nmight be an indication of a deeper damage, like a fracture or internal injury.',\n",
       "  '88 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\n\\x01 Lacerations \\n \\nLacerated wounds are caused by crushing, ripping fo rces by machinery, or clawing of \\nanimals resulting in tears or lacerations. The edge s are mostly irregular in shape. There is \\nusually more underlying tissue damage. These wounds  are often contaminated with \\ngerms; the risk of infection is high. This type of wound sometimes has less bleeding, but is \\nusually very painful. \\n\\x01 Puncture wounds \\n \\nPuncture wounds are caused by stabs or sharp instru ments like knifes, daggers or nails. \\nThese wounds typically have a smaller opening, but may reach deep into the tissue. These \\nmay not be very painful. \\n \\nA stab wound  is a puncture wound by a knife or sharp blade. A gunshot wound  is the \\nwound caused by a bullet or missile driven into the  body. The entry wounds of gunshot \\nwounds are mostly small and neat. If the projectile also exits the body, the exit wound may \\nbe large and ragged.',\n",
       "  '89 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\n \\n\\x01 Amputations \\n \\n \\nAmputation is the removal of a limb by trauma. Re-attachment of amputated limbs, fingers \\nor toes might be possible if the injured and the amputated part(s) arrive at the hospital as \\nsoon as possible. \\nD.1.1  COMPLICATIONS OF WOUNDS  \\nWounds can cause two great dangers: \\n\\x01 Bleeding, and  \\n\\x01 Infection \\nD.1.1.1  BLEEDING  \\nBleeding is the immediate complication of a wound and must be treated immediately.  \\nD.1.1.2  INFECTION  \\nGerms  are tiny, not visible to the human eye, organisms that can cause diseases. Germs are \\nbacteria, viruses, fungi  and protozoa . \\nAn infection is caused by germs getting into the body through th e broken skin. The germs \\nmultiply in the wound and make it ‘infected’, also called as ‘ septic ’. Germs may later get into \\nthe bloodstream and cause a septicaemia . \\nA wound is initially not infected, even though it may be contaminated by dirt or materials that \\ncontain germs. An infection occurs after a lapse of time when the germs have time to multiply \\nand invade the tissues. This time varies with the n umber of germs and their virulence and the \\nbody’s resistance to fight back. Pus formation is part of the body’s method to fight an infection. \\nThe prevention of infection is very important. The first step consists of personal hygiene and the \\nwashing of your hands prior and after taking care of a person.',\n",
       "  '90 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nD.2  SMALL CUTS AND ABRASIONS  \\nEven if the injured person has a small cut or abrasions, you  will still need to take care of the  \\nwound to stop the bleeding and to prevent infection. \\nD.2.1  WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE ?  \\nYou might observe the following signs on a person with a cut or abrasions: \\n\\x01 the skin or the tissue is damaged, \\n\\x01 open skin or tissue might be bleeding, \\n\\x01 the bleeding might be minor or profuse, \\n\\x01 the skin might be discoloured, or \\n\\x01 the casualty might feel pain. \\nD.2.2  WHAT DO I DO ?  \\nD.2.2.1  HYGIENE  \\n1.  Wash your hands before giving care.  Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no \\nsoap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can \\nalso be used, if available. \\nD.2.2.2  STOP THE BLEEDING AND BANDAGE THE WOUND  \\n \\n2.  Try to stop or slow down the bleeding: press on the  wound  with a clean cloth or \\nbandage. If possible, ask the injured person to press on the cut or graze himself to stop \\nthe bleeding. \\n \\n3.  Rinse out the wound with clean water. You can also use boiled  and cooled water.',\n",
       "  '91 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nPour water on the wound until you cannot see any foreign  material left in the wound. If \\nnecessary, wash out the wound  under running water. Foreign material means dirt or \\nanything  else that comes from outside the injured person’s body. \\nIn the event the wound is bleeding profusely, do no t  waste time cleaning it. \\nYour priority is to stop the bleeding by  applying pressure on the wound. \\n \\n4.  If you have a piece of clean (cotton) cloth, then cover the  wound with it. Use adhesive \\nstrips to close a clean cut.  If no strips are available, use a bandage. Bandage the \\ndressing to the wound.   \\nDo not apply the bandage too firmly. If the part of  the body below the bandage \\nchanges colour, is swelling or is feeling numb, loosen the bandage a little bit. \\n \\n5.  Tell the injured person or the person caring for hi m to keep  the wound dry after \\ncleaning with water or getting wet.  Every 2 or 3 days, the wound should be cleaned \\nand  the dressing changed. \\n \\n6.  If a dressing needs to be changed, do not tear the old one off  as this can damage the \\nhealing wound. Instead, put enough  w a t e r  ( p r e f e r a b l y  s a l i n e  w a t e r  i f  \\na v a i l a b l e )  on the old dressing so that it comes off easily. \\n7.

Usually one side of the jaw is \\naffected; however, both sides might be fractured. I n most cases, the fracture is an open \\n(compound) fracture as there is usually a wound inside the mouth also. \\nSpinal fractures can happen indirectly when landing  on the feet or buttocks in a heavy fall, \\nwhen being thrown forward suddenly (like in a car accident during a collision) or when lifting a \\nvery heavy weight.

It is here that \\nsensations are analysed and orders are given to the muscles.  \\nThe brain is encased in the skull and suspended in a clear fluid, called the cerebrospinal fluid \\n(CSF) , which acts as a partial shock absorber. Nonetheless, since the brain is free to move within \\nthe skull the brain is sensitive to violent movements or pressure.  \\nThe brain has three main structures: \\n\\x01 the cerebrum , which is concerned with thought, sensation, and c onscious \\nmovement;      \\n\\x01 the cerebellum , which coordinates movement, balance, and posture;  and  \\n\\x01 the brain stem , which controls basic functions such as breathing.',\n",
       "  '146 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nF.1.1.2  THE SPINAL CORD  \\nThe spinal cord is a mass of nerve fibres extending  from the brain through an opening in the \\nbase of the skull. The cord runs through the spinal column. \\n \\nThe main function of the spinal cord is to convey signals between the brain and the peripheral \\nnervous system. \\nF.1.2  THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (PNS ) \\nThe peripheral nerves emerge in pairs, each contain ing motor and sensory nerves, from the \\nbrain and spinal cord. Sensory nerves transmit impr essions received by the senses (sight, \\nhearing, touch etc.) to the brain and motor nerves then transmit the ‘orders’ given by the brain \\nto the voluntary muscles. When a nerve is cut there  is a loss of feeling, power and movement \\nin that part of the body which is controlled by that nerve. \\nThe peripheral nervous system can be divided in vol untary or somatic nervous system and an \\nautonomic nervous system .  \\nF.1.2.1  THE SOMATIC NERVOUS SYSTEM  \\nThe somatic system is the part of the  peripheral nervous system  that is responsible for carrying \\nmotor and sensory information both to and from the  central nervous system. This system is made \\nup of nerves that connect to the skin, sensory orga ns and all skeletal muscles.

This system is not controlled by the will and acts continuously \\nwhether a person is awake or asleep. It controls di fferent body functions including the activity \\nof the  heart muscle; the smooth muscles, including the mus cles of the intestinal tract; and the \\nglands. The autonomic nervous system has two divisi ons: the sympathetic nervous system, \\nwhich accelerates the heart rate, constricts blood vessels, and raises blood pressure, and',\n",

       "  '148 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nF.2  UNCONSCIOUSNESS  \\nUnconsciousness is a state in which the casualty be comes insensible to commands \\nbecause of an interruption to the normal functioning of the brain. A person has perhaps lost  \\nconsciousness if he does not react to your action b y opening his eyes or answering  your \\nquestions.  \\nThere is no absolute dividing line between consciou sness and un-\\n consciousness. People \\ncan be fully conscious (aware and awake) or fully unconscious (no reaction to any stimulus) \\nor at any level between these two extremes. \\nLoss of consciousness causes the muscles to relax.  During the period of \\nunconsciousness the tongue might fall backwards and block the breathing passage.  \\nIn fainting, the unconscious state is usually brief as in vasovagal syncope .  Fainting can occur \\ndue to various reasons such as emotional distress, tiredness, hunger, standing up for long \\nperiod, a sudden change in body position, being a l ong time in a hot environment, or \\nspecific medical  conditions. Pregnant women, children and the elderl y can be more \\nvulnerable to these causes.  \\nLonger periods of unconsciousness are more serious. Causes include head injuries, cardiac \\narrest, stroke or poisoning.  \\nIn an unconscious state, the person will be unresponsive to your activities (touching,  sounds \\nor other stimulation).  \\nCheck the following:',\n",

The large intestine is a highly speci alized organ that is responsible for \\nprocessing waste so that emptying the bowels is easy and convenient. \\nStool, or waste left over from the digestive proces s, is passed through the colon by means \\nof peristalsis, first in a liquid state and ultimat ely in a semi-solid/solid form. As stool passes \\nthrough the colon, water is removed. Stool is stored in the sigmoid (S-shaped) colon until a \\n\"mass movement\" empties it into the rectum once or twice a day. It normally takes about \\n36 hours for stool to get through the colon. The stool itself is mostly food debris and bacteria. \\nThese bacteria perform several useful functions, su ch as synthesizing various vitamins, \\nprocessing waste products and food particles, and p rotecting against harmful bacteria. \\nWhen the descending colon becomes full of stool, al so called faeces , it empties its \\ncontents into the rectum to begin the process of elimination. \\n\\x01 Rectum',\n",
       "  \"contents into the rectum to begin the process of elimination. \\n\\x01 Rectum \\nThe rectum  is 18 to 20 cm (app. 8-inch) chamber that connects the colon to the anus . It is \\nthe rectum's job to receive stool from the colon, t o let the person know that there is stool \\nto be evacuated, and to hold the stool until evacuation happens. When anything (gas or \\nstool) comes into the rectum, sensors send a message to the brain. The brain then decides \\nif the rectal contents can be released or not. If t hey can, the sphincters relax and the \\nrectum contracts, disposing of its contents. If the  contents cannot be disposed of, the \\nsphincter contracts and the rectum accommodates so that the sensation temporarily \\ngoes away. \\n\\x01 Anus \\nThe anus  is the last part of the digestive tract. It is a 3  to 5 cm (app 2-inch) long canal \\nconsisting of the pelvic floor muscles and the two anal sphincters (internal and external). \\nThe lining of the upper anus is specialized to detect rectal contents.

It is sometimes referred to as maturity-onset \\ndiabetes  because it's more common in older people. \\nG.4.3  GESTATIONAL DIABETES (DIABETES DURING PREGNANCY ) \\nDuring pregnancy, some women have such high levels of blood glucose that their body is \\nunable to produce enough insulin to convert it into  energy.

These burns can result from low voltage \\ncurrent (e.g. home appliances) or high voltage current (e.g. transformers) or by lightning strikes. \\nH.3.2.4  CHEMICAL BURNS  \\nExposure to chemical substances like industrial chemicals, corrosive gases or inhaled chemical \\nfumes can cause chemical burns. Also, the exposure to domestic chemicals and agents as \\npaint stripper, caustic soda, weed killers, bleach,  oven cleaners or strong acids or alkali can \\ncause burns. \\nH.3.2.5  RADIATION BURNS  \\nExposure to radioactive sources, e.g. X-rays or radiotherapy-rays, can result in radiation burns. \\nH.3.2.6  FROST BITES (COLD BURNS )',\n",

However, any burn injury can lead to \\ncomplications. \\nThe danger from burns usually depends more on the area of the burns rather than the degree. \\nSuperficial burns over a large area of the body are  more dangerous than the complete \\ncharring of a part of the limb. It must be noted th at a burn is mostly a mixture itself of different \\ndegrees of burns, and that in the same person different degrees of burns may show on different \\nparts of the body.  \\nThe most important dangers are: \\n\\x01 Infection \\nBurn injuries leave the skin open and susceptible t o infection. Burn injuries also increase \\nyour risk of sepsis, which is a life- threatening i nfection that rapidly travels through the \\nbloodstream. Sepsis can cause shock and organ failure. \\n\\x01 Low blood volume \\nBurn injuries damage the skin and the blood vessels , causing fluids to escape the body. \\nThis can result in low blood volume, known as hypovolemia. A severe loss of fluid and blood \\ncan prevent the heart from pumping enough blood through the body (resulting in shock). \\n\\x01 Low body temperature',\n",
       "  \"can prevent the heart from pumping enough blood through the body (resulting in shock). \\n\\x01 Low body temperature \\nThe skin helps to control the body's temperature. When a large portion of the skin is injured, \\nthe body loses heat. This increases the risk of hypothermia — i.e. when the body loses heat \\nfaster than it can produce – resulting in a dangerously low body temperature. \\n\\x01 Breathing difficulties \\nOne of the most common dangers that accompany burn injuries is the inhalation of smoke \\nor hot air. This can burn the airways, making it difficult to breathe. Smoke can permanently \\ndamage the lungs and lead to respiratory failure. \\n\\x01 Pain \\nBurn wounds are very painful.  \\n\\x01 Disability \\nBurn injuries form scar tissue once healed. When th e skin is burned, the surrounding skin \\nstarts to pull together resulting in a post-burn contracture that prevents movement. Deeper \\nburns can limit movement of the bones or joints when skin, muscles or tendons shorten and \\ntighten, permanently pulling joints out of position.\",\n",

It is  caused by the exposure to ultraviolet rays from \\nthe sun. When UV B rays penetrate the deeper skin layers damage to the cells occurs. The skin \\nbecomes red and painful. In some cases the damage t o the cells is so severe resulting in skin \\npeeling and blistering. \\nStrong or cool wind or a body covered by water or s weat might give the sunbathing person a \\nfalsely reassuring effect of not being sunburned. A s clouds have less limiting effect on UV \\nradiation than they do on temperature, sunburns sti ll can happen on cloudy days. White \\nsurfaces such as snow or sand reflect UV radiation and so increase the risk of sunburn. Rippling \\nwater and rough sea reflect more UV radiation than calm open water. Sunlight has a shorter \\ndistance to travel in order to reach the earth’s su rface in areas closer to the tropics; UV \\nradiation levels will therefore, be higher in these  areas because there is less dissipation of the \\nrays as they travel to earth.

Such substances are called ‘poisons’ or ‘toxins’. \\nPoisoning can occur when these poisons are taken by accident or with a view to  causing \\nharm or committing suicide. \\nPoisons can get into the body by swallowing, inhali ng (gases), by injection or via  \\nabsorption through the skin.  \\nI.1.1  POISONING BY SWALLOWING  \\nPoisoning from swallowing is often caused by househ old products, overdose of  \\nmedication or toxic plants.  \\nThe effects of poisoning depend on what poison has been \\n swallowed. \\n\\x01 Acids, alkalis, disinfectants etc. swallowed burn the lips, tongue, throat, oesophagus \\nand stomach and cause great pain.  \\n\\x01 Other swallowed poisons cause vomiting, pain abdome n and later on diarrhoea \\n(e.g. poisonous fungi, berries, metallic poisons).  \\n\\x01 Some swallowed poisons affect the nervous system. T o this group belong: \\n\\x01 alcoholic drinks (methylated spirit, wine, whisky e tc.) when taken in large \\nquantities; \\n\\x01 sleeping pills, tranquilizers, and painkillers  whe n taken in overdoses. \\nVictims of poisoning must be considered as seriousl y ill.

After the body has taken the \\nfood components that it needs, waste products are left behind in the bowel and in the blood. \\nThe kidney and urinary systems help the body to eli minate liquid waste called urea, and to \\nkeep chemicals, such as potassium and sodium, and water in balance. Urea is produced when \\nfoods containing protein, such as meat, poultry, an d certain vegetables, are broken down in \\nthe body. Urea is carried in the bloodstream to the  kidneys, where it is removed along with \\nwater and other wastes in the form of urine. \\nOther important functions of the kidneys include blood pressure regulation and the production \\n \\nof erythropoietin, which controls red blood cell pr oduction in the bone marrow.

About \\nevery 10 to 15 seconds, small amounts of urine are emptied into the bladder from the ureters. \\nThe bladder, a triangle-shaped, hollow organ, is lo cated in the lower abdomen.

Signs \\nof labour vary from woman to woman, as each woman experiences labour differently.  \\nSome common signs of labour may include: \\n\\x01 A small amount of mucus, slightly mixed with blood,  may be expelled from the \\nvagina indicating a woman is in labour.  \\n \\n\\x01 Contractions (uterine muscle spasms) occurring at i ntervals of less than ten minutes \\nare usually an indication that labour has begun.

The first stage, when the contractions make the cer vix gradually open up (dilate). \\nThis is usually the longest stage. \\n2.  The second stage of labour is when the cervix is fu lly open and birth is given.

The third stage of labour is after the birth, when the womb contracts and causes \\nthe placenta to come out through the vagina. \\nL.3.1.1  THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOUR – DILATION  \\nThe cervix needs to open about ten cm for a baby to  pass through. This is what\\'s called being \\n\"fully dilated \". Contractions at the start of labour help to soft en the cervix so that it gradually \\nopens. \\nThe woman in labour should attempt to get comfortab le and relaxed, and if possible try to \\nsleep. A warm bath or shower may help to relax.  \\nDuring the day, the woman in labour can keep uprigh t and be gently active. This helps the \\nbaby move down into the pelvis and helps the cervix to dilate. \\nOnce labour is established, the cervix reaches an opening of more than three centimetres; the \\ntime to full dilation is usually between 6 and 12 h ours.

To help to overcome the urge to push, breathing out slowly \\nand gently or, if the urge is too strong breathing in small puffs may help. Some women find this \\neasier lying on their side, or on their knees and e lbows, to reduce the pressure of the baby’s \\nhead on the cervix. \\nL.3.1.2  THE SECOND STAGE OF LABOUR  \\nThis is the \"pushing\" stage. It begins when the cervix is fully dilated and lasts until the birth of the \\nbaby.  When the cervix is fully dilated the woman in labour will be asked to push when she feels \\nthe need to do so during contractions.  \\nThis stage of labour is hard work. This stage may take 1-2 hour. \\nWHAT HAPPENS AT THE ACTUAL BIRTH ? \\nDuring the second stage, the baby’s head moves down the vagina until it can be seen. When \\nthe head is almost ready to come out, the woman in labour will be asked to stop pushing and \\nto do a couple of quick short breaths, blowing out through the mouth. This is done so that the \\nbaby’s head can be born slowly and gently, giving t he skin and muscles of the perineum  (the \\narea between the vagina and anus) time to stretch w ithout tearing.

       "  '283 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nM.1  DEFINITION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FIRST AID  \\nIt is a process of facilitating resilience within a n individual to enable to bounce back from the \\nimpact of crisis and help him to deal with the even t/crisis by respecting the independence, \\ndignity and coping mechanism. \\nIn the past first aid was mainly focussed on giving physical first aid to an injured or suddenly sick \\nperson by someone who happens to be present when th e accident happened or the illness \\noccurred. \\nTraumatic events and sickness may stress people. Th ey might feel overwhelmed, worried, \\nconfused or feel uncertainness. Some people might show little or no signs, others might present \\nwith a more severe reaction.   \\nThe SPHERE (2011) and IASC (2007) define psychological first aid (PFA) as a humane, supportive \\nresponse to a fellow human being who is suffering and who may need support. It includes: \\n\\x01 providing practical care and support, which does no t intrude; \\n\\x01 assessing needs and concerns; \\n\\x01 helping people to address basic needs (for example, food and water, information); \\n\\x01 listening to people, but not pressuring them to tal k; \\n\\x01 comforting people and helping them to feel calm; \\n\\x01 helping people connect to information, services and  social supports, and \\n\\x01 protecting people from further harm.',\n",

       "  '284 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nM.2  TRAUMATIC CRISIS  \\n \\nA traumatic crisis is caused by a sudden, unexpected and intense incident.  \\nThe event, as in following examples \\n\\x01 traffic accident, a fire, …; \\n\\x01 natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, …); \\n\\x01 serious illness; \\n\\x01 death of a close one; \\n\\x01 violence, robbery, attack, rape …; \\n\\x01 financial difficulties; \\n\\x01 relational difficulties; \\n\\x01 suicide (attempt); \\n\\x01 etc, \\nproduces a significant emotional shock that temporarily overwhelms the individual. \\nThe traumatic crisis will almost always follow a certain pattern. One may say that the traumatic \\ncrisis can be divided into four phases: \\n1.  (Psychological) Shock phase. \\n2.  Reaction phase. \\n3.  Processing phase. \\n4.  Reorientation phase. \\nM.2.1  (P SYCHOLOGICAL ) SHOCK PHASE  \\nThe shock phase follows immediately after the event which triggered the crisis. During the shock \\nphase, the person is not yet able to comprehend the  event that caused the crisis and may \\neven deny it. While some people in shock become com pletely paralysed, others behave in a \\nmechanical and cold way. Some people in shock may b ecome strongly agitated; they may \\nscream or cry furiously. People may also alternate between paralysis and restlessness states. \\nThe reactions of people in shock, such as apparent lack of feelings, may confuse the people \\nclose to them and even cause embarrassment or resentment.',\n",

       "  '285 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\n\\x01 emotional shutdown, \\n\\x01 feeling surreal and like an outsider, and \\n\\x01 shouting, crying and panic. \\nReactions during the (psychological) shock phase may seem scary and strange. \\nM.2.2  REACTION PHASE  \\nThe immediate danger is over. The person will slowl y face the tragic incident and try to \\nunderstand what has happened. At the beginning of t he reaction phase, people might \\nexperience strange and unexpected sensations; for e xample, they may feel that the person \\nthey have lost is still around or they may hear their voice somewhere.  \\nThe feelings of people in the reaction phase are of ten very similar to each other and they are \\noften expressed in the same form: \"I think I’m going crazy\", \"I can’t take it any more\", \"will I ever \\nmake it through?\", \"life feels like a rollercoaster\", or \"will this pain last forever?\", for example.  \\nThe reaction phase may include: \\n\\x01 fear and anxiety, \\n\\x01 self-accusations and the need to find someone to bl ame, \\n\\x01 sleeplessness and loss of appetite, and \\n\\x01 nausea or other physical symptoms. \\nDuring the reaction phase of a crisis, people often  feel the need to be heard. They may feel \\nthe need to discuss the matter over and over again.  This may feel very heavy and consuming \\nto the people close to the individual.  \\nM.2.3  PROCESSING PHASE',\n",
       "  'to the people close to the individual.  \\nM.2.3  PROCESSING PHASE  \\nIn the processing phase, the person begins to under stand what has happened. The matter is \\nno longer denied; instead, the person understands t hat the incident and all its changes and \\nlosses are really true. The person is ready to face  all the different aspects of the incident and \\nthe new personal situation.  He is aware of the cha nges caused by the crisis and often begins \\nto analyse his own identity and personal convictions and beliefs. He begins to think beyond the \\nevent, but will not yet have strength to plan for the future. Nevertheless, the person is preparing \\nto face the future.  He also regains the capability to better concentrate on everyday’s life. \\nThe processing phase may include: \\n\\x01 problems with memory and concentration, \\n\\x01 irritability, and \\n\\x01 withdrawal from social relationships. \\nM.2.4  REORIENTATION PHASE  \\nThe crisis is over. The person is able to live with what has happened, and it is no longer constantly \\non his mind. Every once in a while, the pain will resurface but there is also joy in life; the person \\nwill be able to look to the future and regain confidence in life. \\nNevertheless, the course of a crisis is not always straightforward; for example, things reminding \\nof the incident can bring back heavy thoughts, anxiety and other symptoms.',\n",
       "  '286 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nM.3  HOW DO I PROVIDE (PSYCHOLOGICAL ) FIRST AID ? \\n \\nLife-saving first aid is a top priority. It is impo rtant to start with limiting the physical injuries.  You \\nmust first and foremost give life-saving first aid where necessary, in order to make sure that the \\ninjured persons get to the hospital alive. Doing the best you can to limit the injuries as much as \\npossible also has a very soothing effect on the injured ones, and on all others present: ‘There is \\nsomeone who helps’. \\nM.3.1  BEHAVE CALMLY  \\nBehaving calmly has a very soothing effect on the c asualties and the psychically affected \\npersons. Calmness can be just as contagious as uneasiness. \\nBehaving calmly is: \\n\\x01 Speaking quietly in a normal pitch. \\n\\x01 Focus the right amount of time on the person you ar e there to help, instead of \\nrunning from one thing to the other. \\n\\x01 Showing clearly that you have time to take care of the affected person. \\n\\x01 Avoiding mentioning that it seems to take too long for the ambulance or other \\nhelping teams to arrive. \\nM.3.2  LISTEN TO THE AFFECTED PERSON  \\nThe affected person must be given the opportunity t o tell what he has experienced. This is \\ncalled “Venting”. \\nYou must accept what he tells you, and you must not comment on it; only ask questions which \\nmake him enlarge upon the subject.',\n",
       "  'You must accept what he tells you, and you must not comment on it; only ask questions which \\nmake him enlarge upon the subject.  \\nPerhaps his account sounds quite unbelievable, but to him that is what he has experienced or \\nthinks he has experienced. By telling about the experiences he gets a chance to recognize for \\nhimself that quite incredible things, which he thin ks he has experienced and which make him \\nfrightened, are not true. This way he can get free of these fantasies.  \\nVenting experiences also has the result that he get s them sorted out and gets them placed in \\nthe proper succession in his memory. It makes it easier to endure having experiences emerging \\nas a tangled series of frightening pictures which he cannot control at all. \\nYou should: \\n\\x01 Try to find a quiet place to talk, and minimize out side distractions. \\n\\x01 Respect privacy and keep the person’s story confide ntial, if this is appropriate.',\n",
       "  '287 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\n\\x01 Behave appropriately by considering the person’s cu lture, age and gender. \\n\\x01 Respect the person’s right to make his own decision s. \\n\\x01 Stay near the person but keep an appropriate distan ce depending on their age, \\ngender and culture. \\n\\x01 Let them know you are listening; for example, nod y our head or say “ hmmmm….” \\n\\x01 Be patient and stay calm. \\n\\x01 Be honest and trustworthy. \\n\\x01 Provide only factual correct information, if you ha ve it. Be honest about what you \\nknow and don’t know. Say “I don’t know, but I will try to find out about that for you.” \\nif you can’t answer the question.  \\n\\x01 Give information in a way the person can understand  and keep it. \\n\\x01 Acknowledge how he is feeling. \\n\\x01 If he tells you about any losses or important event s, such as loss of the home or \\ndeath of a loved one, reply with “I’m so sorry. I can imagine this is very sad for you.” \\n\\x01 Acknowledge the person’s strengths and how he has h elped himself. \\n\\x01 Allow for silence. \\n\\x01 Make it clear to people that even if they refuse help now, they can still access help \\nin the future. \\nM.3.3  GENERAL CONSIDERATION WHEN GIVING HELP  \\nConsider following basic topics when providing help or when you ask bystanders to give help: \\n\\x01 Get his personal belongings gathered. \\n\\x01 Find out where he is going. \\n\\x01 Find out how he got there.',\n",
       "  '\\x01 Get his personal belongings gathered. \\n\\x01 Find out where he is going. \\n\\x01 Find out how he got there. \\n\\x01 Make sure that there is someone who can take care o f the affected one when he \\narrives at the destination. \\nM.3.4  PHYSICAL CONTACT  \\nIt helps incredibly and creates an immediate sense of security, if you take the hand of the \\naffected person or put an arm around his shoulder w hile you listen to him. If he cries - which in \\nitself is very good for him - you can allow him to put his head on your shoulder. \\nPhysical contact is so important because the affect ed person unconsciously will try to protect \\nhimself from the violent psychic trauma by reacting  like a child. For this reason contact with a \\n\"grown-up\" helper may help him to feel more secure.',\n",
       "  '288 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nM.3.5  ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE “H AVE A GOOD CRY ” \\nCrying is a strong outburst of feeling and a means of getting rid of extremely oppressive feelings. \\nIt is therefore very important to cry when the urge to do so arises. \\nBut crying is also very visible and audible express ion of being affected by strong feelings and \\nfor some reason this is considered \"embarrassing\" i n many culture. It is necessary that we set \\naside our culture constraints; when you are giving psychological first aid the affected person \\nshould be allowed to give way to his feelings. Tell him you understand this. \\nM.3.6  PROTECT AGAINST INQUISITIVE ONLOOKERS  \\nThe affected person will be embarrassed showing his feelings, and he will, altogether, feel sorry \\nto let other people see him in this particular situation. \\nA person may react on the onlookers in different ways. He may try to hide himself in an \"ostrich \\nlike\" manner by holding his hands in front of his f ace, but he may just as well react very \\naggressively and abuse them. \\nYour help must consist in getting the affected one away from the onlookers, or make them \\nleave the area. \\nM.3.7  DO NOT LET THE AFFECTED PERSON BE ALONE  \\nEven if the affected person does not like to have p eople around him, it is not a good idea to \\nleave him alone with his psychic crisis. His feelin gs will seem much more oppressive when he is',\n",

In medicine, this is the process \\nof sorting patients in order of priority for treatm ent and evacuation. Triage may take many \\ndifferent forms, and operates at a number of different levels. However, it aims to give the right \\npatient the right care at the right time in the right place. \\nIn certain circumstances, this may also mean ‘doing  the most for the most’. Originally \\ndeveloped for use in military conflicts, triage is equally applicable to civilian disasters and in \\nday-to-day emergency settings. Accurate triage allows correct identification of those patients \\nwho need the most urgent intervention, as well as quickly and safely identifying those who can \\nwait longer for treatment. The latter are the major ity at a typical major incident. Triage may \\nalso be used to identify patients who are so severely injured that they will not survive, or whose \\ntreatment will tie up resources that would be best used for other patients. \\nTriage is dynamic ‒ as the patient’s condition progresses, so his/her need for intervention alters, \\nand the triage category will change. \\nThe casualties are classified in different categories: \\nCategory \\x02 RED \\n(U1 or I) \\nYELLOW \\n(U2 or II) \\nGREEN \\n(U3 or III) \\nBLACK \\nUrgency Extremely \\nurgent. \\nFast treatment \\nneeded. \\nConstant follow',\n",

       "  '299 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\n \\nPlease note: \\n\\x01 There is a fifth category: the non-wounded (sometim es tagged ‘BLUE’).  They are \\nvictims of the incident but seem not to be injured.  \\n\\x01 Inside each category, i.e. the categories RED and Y ELLOW, all casualties of the \\nsame are again ‘categorized by urgency’. For exampl e, casualties with difficult \\nbreathing in category YELLOW will be attended first  before patients in the same \\ncategory with a better condition. \\n\\x01 Triaging is a snapshot of the moment the victim has been evaluated. Victims of one \\ncategory can move in between categories. For exampl e, a patient in category \\nGREEN was walking around, but due to an internal bl eeding his condition \\ndeteriorates and he becomes a category YELLOW, even  RED, depending on his \\n‘new’ condition.  \\n\\x01 In a mass casualty incident assigning the triage ca tegory is done very quickly. The \\ncategory ‘BLACK’ (deceased) may be assigned to all casualties that are not \\nbreathing without even a CPR attempt (as incident i s so massive and there are too \\nmany casualties that have to be attended with very limited resources). When more \\nhelp arrives, and if the situation allows, these vi ctims might be re-evaluated.  \\n\\x01 In most mass casualty disasters, a zone for the RED  (U1), YELLOW (U2) and GREEN \\n(U3), the deceased (BLACK) and non-wounded (BLUE) w ill be assigned.',\n",

These are made from flannel, calico and elastic net or special paper.  \\nIf you have no bandage available, you can improvise one from an everyday item; for example, \\nyou can fold a square of fabric, such as a headscarf, diagonally to make a triangular bandage, \\nand a roller bandage if further folded. A belt, tie  or some other materials can also be used as \\nan improvised bandage. \\nBandages should be applied firm enough to keep dres sing and splints in position, but not as \\ntight as to cause injury to the part or to impede t he circulation of the blood. A bluish tinge of \\nthe finger or nails may be a danger sign indicating  that the bandage is too tight. Loss of \\nsensation is another sign; such bandages should be loosened or removed quickly. \\nO.2.1  TYPES OF BANDAGES  \\nThere are several types of bandages.  \\n\\x01 Triangular bandages (also referred to as “ master bandage ”) can be \\nused as large dressings, or as slings, to secure dr essings or to \\nimmobilize limbs.',\n",

Face the casualty, hold the bandage point firmly, p ut one end of the spread \\ntriangular bandage over the uninjured shoulder with point towards the elbow of the \\ninjured side. \\n2.  Pass the end around the neck and bring it over the injured side shoulder. The other \\nend will now be hanging down over the chest. \\n3.  Place the forearm horizontally across the chest at 90 ° and bring the hanging end \\nup. The forearm is now covered by the bandage. \\n \\n4.  Tie the two ends in such a way that the forearm is horizontal or slightly tilted upward \\nand the knot (reef knot) is placed in the pit above  the collar-bone. \\n5.

One bearer stands between the casualty's legs, faci ng the feet with hands down \\nand grasps the casualty under his knees.  \\n2.  The other bearer takes a position behind the casual ty and after raising his trunk \\npasses his hands under the casualty's armpits and g rasps his own wrists on the \\ncasualty's chest.  \\n3.  The casualty is then lifted.  \\n4.  The bearers walk in step. \\n5.  A chair can be used also to carry the casualty when negotiating a narrow passage \\nor moving up/down the stairs (see kitchen-chair car ry technique). \\n \\nO.4.2.5  THE KITCHEN -CHAIR CARRY TECHNIQUE \\nThe bearers walk in step by carrying the patient in  a chair.

       "  '325 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nO.5  STRETCHERS  \\nStretchers are of two patterns viz. “ordinary\" and “telescopic-handled\". In general principle \\nthey are similar. \\n \\nA stretcher consists of following parts \\n\\x01 poles,  \\n\\x01 handles,  \\n\\x01 jointed traverses,  \\n\\x01 runners,  \\n\\x01 bed,  \\n\\x01 pillow-sack, and  \\n\\x01 slings.  \\nThe \\' head \\' and \\' foot \\' of a stretcher correspond to the head and feet of  the casualty. \\nAt the head of the stretcher may be a canvas overlay (the pillow sack) which can be filled with \\nstraw, hay, clothing etc. to form a pillow. The pil low- sack opens at the head and its contents \\ncan therefore be adjusted without due disturbance o f the casualty.  \\nThe traverses are provided with joints for opening or closing the stretcher.  \\nThe telescopic-handled pattern is similar but its l ength can be reduced to 6 feet by sliding the \\nhandles underneath the poles. This is of a great value when working in confined space, or when \\na casualty has to be taken up or down a narrow stai r-case with sharp turns. \\nWhen closed, the poles of the stretcher lie close t ogether, the transverse bars being bent \\ninwards, the canvas bed neatly folded on the top of the poles and held in position by the slings, \\nwhich are laid along with canvas and secured by a s trap which is placed transversely at the \\nend of each sling and passed through the large loop  of the other, and round the poles and \\nbed.',\n",

       "  '326 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nO.5.1.1  BLANKET LIFT  \\n1.  In the blanket lift, a blanket is placed under the casualty (as described earlier).  \\n2.  If poles of good length and rigidity are available, roll the blanket over the poles until \\nthe poles are pressed to the sides of the casualty.  \\nIf poles are not available, the blanket itself is r olled up tightly to the sides of the \\ncasualty. \\n3.  If necessary, broad bandages are places around the body, one at the level of the \\nthigh, another at the level of the shoulders.  \\n4.  Lift the casualty and place the stretcher exactly u nder the casualty. \\n5.  In case of potential injuries to head, neck, spine or legs, two bearers should support \\nthe neck and ankle. \\n6.  Lower the casualty on the stretcher. \\n7.  Secure the casualty on the stretcher. \\nO.5.1.2  EMERGENCY LIFT  \\n \\n1.  If no blanket is available, the following method is used: Open the casualty’s coat or \\nbush-coat and roll the free ends firmly close up to  the side of the casualty’s body. \\n2.  Lift the casualty and put him on the stretcher as d escribed above.',\n",
       "  '327 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nO.5.2  LIFTING AND LOWERING A STRETCHER  \\n \\n1.  At the command “Lower Stretcher\", the two or four b earers will stoop, gently lower \\nthe stretcher to the ground and rise together. \\n2.  At the command “Lift Stretcher\", they will then ris e steadily together keeping the \\nstretcher level.  \\nO.5.3  CARRYING A LOADED STRETCHER  \\n                               \\nDepending on the availability of manpower one can d ecide whether the stretcher is to be \\ncarried by four or two persons. \\nIn case of four helpers, each helper takes one handle of the stretcher and walks on the outside \\nof the stretcher. \\nIn case of two helpers carrying, one helper takes t he head side, the other the opposite side. \\nThey are positioned between the handles and take th e both handles to hold the stretcher. \\nThey may decide to use a sling well over their shoulders and on the handles of the stretcher to \\nhelp them to carry the stretcher. \\nO.5.4  LOADING A STRETCHER INTO AN AMBULANCE  \\nThe stretcher is lowered with its head one pace from the door of the ambulance. The casualty \\nwill be loaded head first. While loading, take side pace to the ambulance raising the stretcher \\nevenly to the level of the berth to be loaded. The front bearers place the runners in the grooves',\n",

       "  '329 TITLE OF CHAPTER  \\nO.6  MOVING AND TRANSPORTING A CASUALTY SUSPECTED OF A HE AD , NECK \\nOR SPINAL INJURY  \\nTo prevent further injury, a casualty with a suspec ted head, neck or spinal injury shall be \\nhandled with the greatest care. \\nTo transport a casualty suspected of a head, neck or spinal injury: \\n1.  Prepare the stretcher; the soft bed of the canvas type of stretcher must be stiffened, \\npreferably by placing short boards across the stretchers, or long ones lengthwise on \\nthe canvas if only these are available. If no stret cher is available, a narrow shutter, \\ndoor or board of at least the same width and length  as the patient may be used. \\n2.  Cover the stretcher with a folded blanket and then blanket the stretcher. \\nPlace pillows or pads in readiness on the stretcher  in a position to support the neck, \\nand small part of the back. Those should be suffici ently large, but not too large, to \\npreserve the normal curves of the spine. \\n3.  Whenever the casualty is to be moved or lifted he must not be bent, twisted or over \\nextended. One bearer must apply firm but gentle sup port to the head and face, \\nso as to prevent neck movement and another bearer must steady and support the \\nlower limbs to prevent trunk movement. This must be  continued until the casualty \\nhas been placed on the stretcher. \\n4.  When the casualty is not already lying on a blanket  or rug.',\n",
